The NumPy is a python library or module that offers different functions to operate on various types of mathematical arrays e.g, addition, subtraction, division, and angles etc.

The **.deg2rad()** function of NumPy in python converts degree angle to radian, meanwhile the order could be reverse to **rad2deg().**, when changing values from radian to degree. 

> To grasp this topic, basic understand of the difference between degree and radian, with what numerical python (NumPy) entail, is needed. 

### How to convert degrees angle to radian angle with the.deg2rad() maths function
  
**To convert degree to radian:**

1. Import the NumPy library using the: 
Import NumPy as np
2. Declare a variable, then arrange an arrays of angles in degree:

` F=np.arrays[136, 179, 53,45, 83] `

3. Directly convert the degree angle to radians with:
   
` z=np.radian(F)`

4. Or convert the arrays from degree to radian attaching:
 `E1=deg2rad(F)`
5. It can be reversed to: 
` E2=rad2deg(E1)`
6. To showcase the result of degree to radian:
` Print (E1)`
7. And to display the radian to degree: 
 `Print(E2)`
